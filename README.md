# Calc
Built my first interactive web project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — a fully functional calculator. This project helped me understand how structure, styling, and logic work together. It performs basic arithmetic operations with dynamic display updates and responsive UI, marking the start of my front-end development journey.
